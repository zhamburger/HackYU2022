# HackYU2022
At the YU Hackathon 2022, we created a system called HospiPAL designed to connect low income hospitals to those with excess to solve the pressing issue of wasted medical equipment. Our system allows hospitals to post equipment that they no longer need, or request equipment if they are lacking. Once a post and a request align, our system emails the involved hospitals to arrange the tradeoff. We built the backend using Javascript and Node, which connects to a MongoDB cluster as the database of all hospital and equipment information. The database also allows for queries based on equipment type so that hospitals in need can search through what is available. As for the front end, we built a login page and a postings page using React Native. Given more time, we would have looked to flesh out the front end further and more seamlessly connect it to the database.
